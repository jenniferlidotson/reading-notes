# Class 2 Reading Notes

## Introduction to HTML

HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document, structure a document into logical sections, and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 

- Advanced text formatting: marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information

## CSS Structure

- External stylesheet: An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. 

- Internal stylesheet: An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a <style> element contained inside the HTML <head>.

## JavaScript basics

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation

## Making decisions in your code â€” conditionals

Code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime.
