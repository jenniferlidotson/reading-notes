# Class 5 Reading Notes

## JavaScript object basics

- An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

## Document Object Model (DOM)

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

- A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

## How to Solve Programming Problems

- Read the problem completely twice.

- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

- Optimize the manual steps.

- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

- Optimize the real code.

**As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.**

## What’s the Difference Between Primitive Values and Object References in JavaScript?

- All data types in JavaScript can be put into one of two categories: primitive values and object references.

Primitive values and object references behave differently. This difference in behavior affects how variable assignments are made, how equality operators get their results, and how JavaScript programs run in general. 

- JavaScript currently supports eight different data types. This includes seven primitive value types and objects. Here’s the full list:

Boolean
Null
Undefined
Number
BigInt
String
Symbol
Objects

**Arrays, functions, and dates all play an important role in JavaScript programs, but they are really just objects under the hood.**
