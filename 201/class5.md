# Class 5 Reading Notes

## Multimedia and embedding

- Images in HTML <img> and <figure>

- Video and audio content <video> and <audio> 

- <iframe>, <embed> and <object> elements

- vector graphics SVG format

- Responsive images

## Images in HTML

- for example, if your image is called dinosaur.jpg, and it sits in the same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image 

## Image file type and format guide

- External stylesheet: An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. 

- Internal stylesheet: An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a <style> element contained inside the HTML <head>.

## style HTML using CSS

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation

## Applying color to HTML elements using CSS

- Text: Whenever an element is rendered, these properties are used to determine the color of the text, its background, and any decorations on the text.

- Boxes: Every element is a box with some sort of content, and has a background and a border in addition to whatever contents the box may have.

- Borders: Any element can have a border drawn around it. A basic element border is a line drawn around the edges of the element's content.

## Fundamental text and font styling

- Font styles: Properties that affect a text's font, e.g., which font gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.

- Text layout styles: Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.
