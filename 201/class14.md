## Psychological Safety

- Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ 

- Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’

- The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

- What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? Enthusiasm for one another’s ideas, joking around and having fun. These norms allows everyone to feel relaxed and energized.

- Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. I was on a team recently that always made me feel totally exhausted and it affected my sleep so badly that I got insomnia. This team was so draining because people always had a tendency to critique each other in a very competitive environment.

- What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? Communication and empathy are the building blocks of forging real connections. This leads to teams that are faster, better and more productive.
