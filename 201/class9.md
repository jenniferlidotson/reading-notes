# Class 8 Reading Notes

## CSS - Flexbox: Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension.

- They can display as a row, or a column.

- They respect the writing mode of the document.

- They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.

- Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.

- Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.

- Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.

 - The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.

## CSS - Layout

- Inline elements behave like words in a sentence. They sit next to each other in the inline direction. Elements such as <span> and <strong>, which are typically used to style pieces of text within containing elements like a <p> (paragraph), are inline by default. They also preserve surrounding whitespace.

- You can't set an explicit width and height on inline elements. Any block level margin and padding will be ignored by the surrounding elements.

- Block elements don't sit alongside each other. They create a new line for themselves. Unless changed by other CSS code, a block element will expand to the size of the inline dimension, therefore spanning the full width in a horizontal writing mode. The margin on all sides of a block element will be respected.

### Things I want to know more about

- How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
