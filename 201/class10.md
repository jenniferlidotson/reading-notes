# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Debugging - Troubleshooting JavaScript.

- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

- Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

- A web form's HTML is made up of one or more form controls (sometimes called widgets), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form — they are often referred to as HTML forms. The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the <input> element, although there are some other elements to learn about too.

- Form controls can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to be entered (form validation), and paired with text labels that describe their purpose to both sighted and visually impaired users.

- The form element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the form's behavior. Each time you want to create an HTML form, you must start it by using this element, nesting all the contents inside. Many assistive technologies and browser plugins can discover<form elements and implement special hooks to make them easier to use.

- The fieldset element is a convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes. You can label a fieldset by including a legend element just below the opening fieldset tag. The text content of the legend formally describes the purpose of the fieldset it is included inside.

- Many assistive technologies will use the legend element as if it is a part of the label of each control inside the corresponding fieldset element. For example, some screen readers such as Jaws and NVDA will speak the legend's content before speaking the label of each control.

## Learn JS

- JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functionalities on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
 
- JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies such as HTML and CSS. 
 
- JavaScript is an actively evolving language and has changed greatly over the years. In particular, the 6th edition of the language (sometimes known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES6), introduced in 2015, added many new features. At the same time, to maintain backwards compatibility with older websites, old features of the language have been retained, even when they are no longer considered good practice.

 ## Introduction To Events
 
- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.

- For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box. I
 
### Things I want to know more about

- If the user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.

- If the user chooses a key on the keyboard.

- If the user resizes or closes the browser window.

- If a web page finishes loading.

- If a form is submitted.

- If a video is played, paused, or ends.

- If an error occurs.
