# Class 1 Reading Notes

Here are my notes about Markdown

Markdown is a very easy-to-use language in plain text that will add formatting elements like headings, bulleted lists, and links to URLs without the use of a formal text editor or the use of HTML tags.

For any non-technical friend interested in learning about Markdown, I recommend starting by watching an overview video that explains how simple it can be to create websites that showcase your hobbies, your projects or anything else you want to share with the world.

Here are examples of some [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

- In order to **bold** text, add two ** before and after a word.

- In order to *italicize* text, add one * before and after a word.
