# Class 1 Reading Notes

Here are my notes about Markdown

Markdown is a very easy-to-use language in plain text that will add formatting elements like headings, bulleted lists, and links to URLs without the use of a formal text editor or the use of HTML tags. In fact, Markdown is much easier to write than HTML and I wish I learned Markdown before I learned HTML!

For any non-technical friend interested in learning about Markdown, I recommend starting by watching an overview video that explains how simple it can be to create websites that showcase your hobbies, your projects or anything else you want to share with the world.  Check out [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com).

Here are examples of some [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

- In order to *italicize* text, add one * before and after a word.

- In order to **bold** text, add two ** before and after a word.

- In order to ***italicize and bold*** text at the same time, add three *** before and after a word.

Since there are so many great options, I recommended bookmarking this [website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) about writing and formatting syntax.
