# reading-notes
Welcome to my reading journal for Code Fellows after reading an article from our friends [Inside Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

Aloha!  My name is Jennifer and I think coding is *challenging and fun!* 

Growth mindset means I believe in myself and I can accomplish tasks that are hard.

## Here are some reminders to help me stay in a growth mindset:

- I will try **again**.
- I will be **patient**.
- I will **improve**.
