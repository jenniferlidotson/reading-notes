# Class 8 Reading Notes

Operators and Loops

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type that have side effects. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type that evaluate. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. 

All complex expressions are joined by operators, such as = and +.

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.
