# Class 7 Reading Notes

[JavaScript Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

For Example:
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure. It is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Things I want to know more about

* For function userGreeting, I'd like to make sure the person types in their name correctly with initial capitalization.  This would help with keeping clean database records.
