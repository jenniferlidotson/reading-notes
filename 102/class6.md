# Class 6 Reading Notes

[What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language. JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include dynamic script creation. During this assignment, we focused on adding dynamic components based on user input and other dynamic input data. We also included a dynamic component based on a conditional statement to determine the output as well as trying out the confirm function, in addition to prompt.

## Things I want to know more about

* ***Tip:*** Remember how developers usually print out debugging information <script> console.log("Hello World"); </script>

* ***Tip:*** Remember calling the confirm() function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses OK the confirm() function will return true, if the user presses cancel or hits the ESC key, the function will return false. <script> if (confirm("Shall I print Hello World?")) { document.write("Hello World"); } else {    document.write("OK, I won't print it."); } </script>
