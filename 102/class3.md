# Class 3 Reading Notes

What is a Git?

Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

## Here is Git "cheat sheet” that are used often in workflow

* git status - when should you use it? use it all the time!!! show your status in the ACP process, changes, etc.

*git add <filename> stages your snapshot! choose which files to commit (takes a snapshot of it)

* git add <filename> <filename> <filename>  (this chains the filenames together)

* git add . - stages all the changes in the current directory , any changes that it can see in the directory (directory = folder, ex mkdir) 

* git commit -m "message goes here"  -adds a message to our snapshot/commit , save it where it's at right now with a message 

* git clone <paste your link> copies repository down from github (remote) to your computer (local) git push origin main - send our changes to github

* git pull origin main - in case you need to bring changes from github to local repo

## Things I want to know more about

- Resolving gituations, merging conflicts when working with team members

- Shortcuts that will help me code faster
