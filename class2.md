# Class 2 Reading Notes

Here are my notes about Text Editors

There are many different classifications of text editors. It is important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code. The top features are highlighted in this [article](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) by The Older Coder:

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection ofextensions available when you need them

(I can definitely appreciate #3 in my old age!) :joy:

## Here are three useful commands for navigation in terminal

## Things I want to know more about

- After getting a preview of VS Code, I'm excited to dig in deeper!

- After hearing about Shortcuts, I'm excited to commit them to my memory!
