# Class 2 Reading Notes

Here are my notes about Text Editors

There are many different classifications of text editors. It is important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code. The top features are highlighted in this [article](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) by The Older Coder:

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection ofextensions available when you need them

Here are three great "cheat sheets‚Äù for basic terminal usage:

1. [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.phpO
2. [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)
3. [About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)



## Here are examples of some [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

- In order to *italicize* text, add one * before and after a word.

- In order to **bold** text, add two ** before and after a word.

- In order to ***italicize and bold*** text at the same time, add three *** before and after a word.

Since there are so many great options, I also recommended bookmarking this [website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) about writing and formatting syntax. 

## Things I want to know more about

- Using [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) for further customizations

- Using Supported Color Modules such as `#0969DA` 

- Using [Emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet#emoji-cheat-sheet) to keep things fun :smile: :+1: :heart:
